   Some error recovery procedures are common to all states of the
   control connection.  If an expected reply does not arrive within 60
   seconds, the control connection is closed, unless otherwise
   specified.  Appropriate logging should be implemented for easy
   determination of the problems and the reasons for closing the control
   connection.

   Receipt of an invalid or malformed Control Connection message should
   be logged appropriately, and the control connection should be closed
   and restarted to ensure recovery into a known state.

3.1.  Control Connection States

   The control connection relies on a standard TCP connection for its
   service.  The PPTP control connection protocol is not distinguishable
   between the PNS and PAC, but is distinguishable between the
   originator and receiver. The originating peer is the one which first
   attempts the TCP open. Since either PAC or PNS may originate a
   connection, it is possible for a TCP collision to occur.  See section
   3.1.3 for a description of this situation.

   idle
      The control connection originator attempts to open a TCP
      connection to the peer during idle state. When the TCP connection
      is open, the originator transmits a send Start-Control-
      Connection-Request and then enters the wait_ctl_reply state.

   wait_ctl_reply
      The originator checks to see if another TCP connection has been
      requested from the same peer, and if so, handles the collision
      situation described in section 3.1.3.

      When a Start-Control-Connection-Reply is received, it is examined
      for a compatible version. If the version of the reply is lower
      than the version sent in the request, the older (lower) version
      should be used provided it is supported.  If the version in the
      reply is earlier and supported, the originator moves to the
      established state. If the version is earlier and not supported, a
      Stop-Control-Connection-Request SHOULD be sent to the peer and the
      originator moves into the wait_stop_reply state.

   established
      An established connection may be terminated by either a local
      condition or the receipt of a Stop-Control-Connection-Request. In
      the event of a local termination, the originator MUST send a
      Stop-Control-Connection-Request and enter the wait_stop_reply
      state.

      If the originator receives a Stop-Control-Connection-Request it
      SHOULD send a Stop-Control-Connection-Reply and close the TCP
      connection making sure that the final TCP information has been
      "pushed" properly.

   wait_stop_reply
      If a Stop-Control-Connection-Reply is received, the TCP connection
      SHOULD be closed and the control connection becomes idle.

   idle
      The control connection receiver waits for a TCP open attempt on
      port 1723. When notified of an open TCP connection, it should
      prepare to receive PPTP messages.  When a Start-Control-
      Connection-Request is received its version field should be
      examined. If the version is earlier than the receiver's version
      and the earlier version can be supported by the receiver, the
      receiver SHOULD send a Start-Control-Connection-Reply. If the
      version is earlier than the receiver's version and the version
      cannot be supported, the receiver SHOULD send a Start-Connection-
      Reply message, close the TCP connection and remain in the idle
      state.  If the receiver's version is the same as earlier than the
      peer's, the receiver SHOULD send a Start-Control-Connection-Reply
      with the receiver's version and enter the established state.

   established
      An established connection may be terminated by either a local
      condition or the reception of a Stop-Control-Connection-Request.
      In the event of a local termination, the originator MUST send a
      Stop-Control-Connection-Request and enter the wait_stop_reply
      state.

RFC 2637        Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)       July 1999


      If the originator receives a Stop-Control-Connection-Request it
      SHOULD send a Stop-Control-Connection-Reply and close the TCP
      connection, making sure that the final TCP information has been
      "pushed" properly.

   wait_stop_reply
      If a Stop-Control-Connection-Reply is received, the TCP connection
      SHOULD be closed and the control connection becomes idle.

3.1.3.  Start Control Connection Initiation Request Collision

   A PAC and PNS must have only one control connection between them. It
   is possible, however, for a PNS and a PAC to simultaneously attempt
   to establish a control connection to each other. When a Start-
   Control-Connection-Request is received on one TCP connection and
   another Start-Control-Connection-Request has already been sent on
   another TCP connection to the same peer, a collision has occurred.

   The "winner" of the initiation race is the peer with the higher IP
   address (compared as 32 bit unsigned values, network number more
   significant). For example, if the peers 192.33.45.17 and 192.33.45.89
   collide, the latter will be declared the winner.  The loser will
   immediately close the TCP connection it initiated, without sending
   any further PPTP control messages on it and will respond to the
   winner's request with a Start-Control-Connection-Reply message. The
   winner will wait for the Start-Control-Connection-Reply on the
   connection it initiated and also wait for a TCP termination
   indication on the connection the loser opened.  The winner MUST NOT
   send any messages on the connection the loser initiated.

3.1.4.  Keep Alives and Timers

   A control connection SHOULD be closed by closing the underlying TCP
   connection under the following circumstances:

   1. If a control connection is not in the established state (i.e.,
      Start-Control-Connection-Request and Start-Control-Connection-
      Reply have not been exchanged), a control connection SHOULD be
      closed after 60 seconds by a peer waiting for a Start-Control-
      Connection-Request or Start-Control-Connection-Reply message.

   2. If a peer's control connection is in the established state and has
      not received a control message for 60 seconds, it SHOULD send a
      Echo-Request message. If an Echo-Reply is not received 60 seconds
      after the Echo-Request message transmission, the control
      connection SHOULD be closed.

3.2.  Call States

3.2.1.  Timing considerations

   Because of the real-time nature of telephone signaling, both the PNS
   and PAC should be implemented with multi-threaded architectures such
   that messages related to multiple calls are not serialized and
   blocked. The transit delay between the PAC and PNS should not exceed
   one second. The call and connection state figures do not specify
   exceptions caused by timers. The implicit assumption is that since
   the TCP-based control connection is being verified with keep-alives,
   there is less need to maintain strict timers for call control
   messages.

   Establishing outbound international calls, including the modem
   training and negotiation sequences, may take in excess of 1 minute so
   the use of short timers is discouraged.

   If a state transition does not occur within 1 minute (except for
   connections in the idle or established states), the integrity of the
   protocol processing between the peers is suspect and the ENTIRE
   CONTROL CONNECTION should be closed and restarted. All Call IDs are
   logically released whenever a control connection is started. This
   presumably also helps in preventing toll calls from being "lost" and
   never cleared.

3.2.2.  Call ID Values

   Each peer assigns a Call ID value to each user session it requests or
   accepts. This Call ID value MUST be unique for the tunnel between the
   PNS and PAC to which it belongs. Tunnels to other peers can use the
   same Call ID number so the receiver of a packet on a tunnel needs to
   associate a user session with a particular tunnel and Call ID.  It is
   suggested that the number of potential Call ID values for each tunnel
   be at least twice as large as the maximum number of calls expected on
   a given tunnel.

   A session is defined by the triple (PAC, PNS, Call ID).

3.2.3.  Incoming Calls

   An Incoming-Call-Request message is generated by the PAC when an
   associated telephone line rings. The PAC selects a Call ID and serial
   number and indicates the call bearer type.  Modems should always
   indicate analog call type.  ISDN calls should indicate digital when
   unrestricted digital service or rate adaption is used and analog if





Hamzeh, et al.               Informational                     [Page 41]

RFC 2637        Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)       July 1999


   digital modems are involved. Dialing number, dialed number, and
   subaddress may be included in the message if they are available from
   the telephone network.

   Once the PAC sends the Incoming-Call-Request, it waits for a response
   from the PNS but does not answer the call from the telephone network.
   The PNS may choose not to accept the call if:

      -  No resources are available to handle more sessions

      -  The dialed, dialing, or subaddress fields are not indicative of
         an authorized user

      -  The bearer service is not authorized or supported

   If the PNS chooses to accept the call, it responds with an Incoming-
   Call-Reply which also indicates window sizes (see section 4.2). When
   the PAC receives the Outgoing-Call-Reply, it attempts to connect the
   call, assuming the calling party has not hung up. A final call
   connected message from the PAC to the PNS indicates that the call
   states for both the PAC and the PNS should enter the established
   state.

   When the dialed-in client hangs up, the call is cleared normally and
   the PAC sends a Call-Disconnect-Notify message. If the PNS wishes to
   clear a call, it sends a Call-Clear-Request message and then waits
   for a Call-Disconnect-Notify.

The states associated with the PAC for incoming calls are:

   idle
      The PAC detects an incoming call on one of its telco interfaces.
      Typically this means an analog line is ringing or an ISDN TE has
      detected an incoming Q.931 SETUP message. The PAC sends an
      Incoming-Call-Request message and moves to the wait_reply state.

   wait_reply
      The PAC receives an Incoming-Call-Reply message indicating non-
      willingness to accept the call (general error or don't accept) and
      moves back into the idle state. If the reply message indicates
      that the call is accepted, the PAC sends an Incoming-Call-
      Connected message and enters the established state.

   established
      Data is exchanged over the tunnel.  The call may be cleared
      following:

         An event on the telco connection. The PAC sends a
         Call-Disconnect-Notify message

         Receipt of a Call-Clear-Request.  The PAC sends a
         Call-Disconnect-Notify message

         A local reason. The PAC sends a Call-Disconnect-Notify message.
